###
###S3 Object are considered "informal" and more "dynamic" (more user friendly) and aren't technically defined. It's more or less a list with a class name.  primarily use 

### to determine type - "typeof"

### Generic functions are more or less function "shells" that dispatch a method
### and contain a "simpler" function like plot. In essence the look at the class 
### and determine the appropriate methods.

###S3 objects are older and much easier to work with, have implicit constructors, and can be made while building a list
### while S4 requires more careful construction, is newer, and is less friendly with error checking (it checks more).
