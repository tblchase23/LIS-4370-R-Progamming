## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary (mtcars)
head(mtcars)
mean(mtcars$mpg)

mtcars_weirdstat <- mean(mtcars$cyl) + mean(mtcars$disp)
mtcars_weirdstat

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, include=TRUE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp)) +
  geom_point()

plot(mpg)

```
